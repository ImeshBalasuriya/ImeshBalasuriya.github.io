# About Me<a name="about"></a>

I am a third-year Computer Engineering undergraduate at the [Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya](http://www.ce.pdn.ac.lk) with a strong interest in Computer Architecture and Computer Vision.

<br>

# Skills and Experience<a name="skills"></a>

I am fluent in several programming languages such as **C, Java and Python** and am familiar with languages like **C++ and MATLAB**.

I have a good background in **hardware programming** with experience developing **ARM Assembly** code, programming microcontrollers using **AVR C**, and hardware design using **Verilog-HDL**.

Additionally, I am interested in the fields of **Image Processing** and **Computer Vision**, with hands-on experience in using the **OpenCV** library.

I have also worked as a [Casual Instructor (Teaching Assistant)](https://people.ce.pdn.ac.lk/students/e17/018) at the [Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya](http://www.ce.pdn.ac.lk) for the following courses.
* CO221 - Digital Design
* CO224 - Computer Architecture
* CO323 - Computer Communication Networks II
* CO325 - Computer and Network Security
