# About Me<a name="about"></a>

I am a final-year Computer Engineering undergraduate at the [Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya](http://www.ce.pdn.ac.lk) with a strong interest in Computer Architecture and Compilers.

<br>

# Skills and Experience<a name="skills"></a>

My primary focus lies in **low-level development** and **programming languages** with a solid background in developing **ARM Assembly** code, programming **microcontrollers**, and hardware design using **Verilog-HDL**. I have a good conceptual understanding and practical experience with **compiler design** as well.

I am also interested in **DevOps Engineering** practices with a sound knowledge of CI/CD techniques. I have practical experience working with **GitHub Actions**, **Ansible**, **Jenkins** and cloud service providers (**AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**), and am familiar with technologies like **Docker**, **Kubernetes** and **Terraform**.

Additionally, my interests extend to the fields of **Image Processing** and **Computer Vision**, with hands-on experience in using the **OpenCV** library.

I have also worked as a [Casual Instructor (Teaching Assistant)](https://people.ce.pdn.ac.lk/students/e17/018) at the [Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya](http://www.ce.pdn.ac.lk) for the following courses.
* CO221 - Digital Design
* CO224 - Computer Architecture
* CO323 - Computer Communication Networks II
* CO325 - Computer and Network Security
